 Ultrasonic Distance Meter
This project presents a functional and versatile distance measurement device .

Features:
  Real-Time Distance Sensing: Utilizes an ultrasonic sensor for live, accurate distance readings.
  Dimensional Analysis: Capable of measuring and storing dimensions to calculate the length and width of surfaces (e.g., walls).
  Integrated Cost Estimation: Calculates the total area from measurements and applies a predefined unit cost built into the software to estimate project material costs automatically.
