Project 1 - Electronic message board
 
Components:

Arduino Uno R3
18 M2M jumper wires
1 potentiometer
1 1kΩ resistor
1 220Ω resistor
1 16x2 lcd
1 push button
1 breadboard

Project description:
This project has an lcd screen, which, when you press a push button, It displays a new message, looping again to the first message if you click through every message. It also has a potentiometer, which adjusts the contrast of the screen, and an Arduino Uno, which stores all the code. You can replace the messages in the code, as well as the amount of messages, by changing and moving a bit of the code. This could be useful as a replacement to bulletin boards, and large scale applications can be seen outside of shops, schools, and more.
